libbase (1.1.6-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * merge from Ubuntu:
    - Fix FTBFS in Ubuntu due to download of ant-contrib from sourceforge:
      + d/control: Add ant-contrib to Build-Depends.
      + d/ant.properties: set ant-contrib jar directory to /usr/share/java so
        that ant build.xml thinks its already downloaded.
      + d/rules: include ant-contrib in DEB_JARS.
    - Use standard DEB_ANT_CHECK_TARGET to execute unit testing:
      + d/rules: include ant-junit in DEB_JARS, uncomment DEB_ANT_CHECK_TARGET
        and remove bespoke target to execute tests.
