A list of changes in recent versions:

1.0.0: (30-May-2008)

       * [BUG] Serialized configurations did not reconnect with a global
         configuration. 
         
       * [BUG] Booting no longer stores references to all booted classes
         in a global collection.

       * [BUG] Fixed a deadlock when booting failed and a second boot attempt
         was made.

       * Downported I18N support from the engine.

       * Imported the majority of the sources from the stale JCommon project.

       * Switched logging to Apache-Commons-Logging.

       * Added a ClassQueryTool that (given enough perm-gen space) travereses
         through all classes on the classpath and can return the names of all
         classes matching a given criteria.

         It is not recommended to use this class at runtime; but it is a great
         tool for build-time generators for configuration files.

       * CSV-Reader and Writer support added.

       * StringUtils now contain a equivalent for the split method, but without
         relying on the expensive regular expressions. The StringTokenizer is
         a lot faster.

       * The module-configuration no longer relies on a home-grown fileformat
         and uses standard properties-files for describing modules and dependencies.

       * This code is a fork based on JCommon-1.0.12. JCommon is about to be
         deprecated and development on the JCommon library will stop as 
         JFreeChart 1.2 is released.
